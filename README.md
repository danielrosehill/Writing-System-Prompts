# System Prompts For Writing & Communications Utilities

![Last Updated](https://img.shields.io/badge/Last%20Updated-March%2025%2C%202025-blue)

This is a collection of system prompts derived from my larger collection of system prompts. The commonality here is that these system prompts are intended for assistance related to writing, specifically text reformatting, editing, proofing. This is a partial collection that will continue to hopefully evolve and grow over time. 

The system prompts are organised into folders representing a common purpose and within each folder each system prompt is recorded as a markdown file and within the markdown file the system prompt is provided. 

The utilities range from those intended for basic text editing and spell checking through to more specific utilities like data processing and include some assistance that will be of use primarily for those working in communications or niche fields within writing like technical documentation and communications. 

These system prompts can be used in any AI tool and feel free to use.
